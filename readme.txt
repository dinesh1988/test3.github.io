ABOUT Theme
=========== 

Retailer is an ecommerce theme for online retailers. It is a child theme of the Storefront theme, so this must be installed first, along with the WooCommerce plugin for ecommerce functionality. Via the customizer you can choose from a range of layout and color options as well as uploading your own logo and header images etc. The also theme includes reviews markup so your products can get the star rating in the search results.

This theme is compatible with Wordpress Version 3.4 and above and it supports the new theme customization API (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API).
